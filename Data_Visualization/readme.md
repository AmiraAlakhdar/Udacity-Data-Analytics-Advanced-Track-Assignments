## Summary of Findings

> Duration has a long-tailed right-skewed distribution, however when, plotted on a log scale, it showed a normal logaritmic distribution, with a lot bars in the high end, and fewer bars on the low price end, but one of them shows a significant frequency between 4-5 minutes.
> The month and weekday variables had an almost uniform distribution.
> The distribution of the bike type, pass holder and trip route variables showed:
about 80% of the trips are done with strandard bike type, and the remaining use electric bikes.
Indego30 is the most frequent pass holder type in all trips.
Over 80% of the trips are One way route type.

> The two graphs for popoular start locations and popular end locations look identical which means that there are areas with higher numbers of bike riders where the company should increase the number of bikes.
